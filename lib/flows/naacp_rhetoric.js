      Letter A: First Lady of the United States to Walter White, Executive
      Secretary of the NAACP, addressing the lynching situation.
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      “Before I received your letter today I had been in to the President… and
      he said the difficulty is that it is unconstitutional apparently for the
      Federal Government to step in in the lynching situation… The President
      feels that lynching is a question of education in the states, rallying
      good citizens, and creating public opinion so that the localities
      themselves will wipe it out. However, if it were done by a Northerner, it
      will have an antagonistic effect… I am deeply troubled about the whole
      situation as it seems to be a terrible thing to stand by and let it
      continue… I think your next step would be to talk to the more prominent
      members of the Senate.”
    </Paragraph>
    <Heading>
      Letter B: Daisy Bates to Roy Wilkins, Executive Secretary of the NAACP,
      describing the conditions of black children in a previously all-white
      school.
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      “Conditions are yet pretty rough in the school for the children… The
      treatment of the children had been getting steadily worse for the last two
      weeks in the form of kicking, spitting, and general abuse. As a result of
      our visit, stronger measures are being taken against the white students
      who are guilty of committing these offenses… [The President of the United
      States] was very much concerned about the crisis… He has stated his
      willingness to come down and address the student body if invited by
      student leaders of the school… Last Friday, the 13th, I was asked to call
      Washington and see if we could get FBI men placed in the school.”
