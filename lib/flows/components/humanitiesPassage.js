    <Paragraph>
      “There is evidence that primitive populations suffer relatively low rates of many diseases compared to the more affluent modern societies. Primitive populations appear to enjoy several nutritional advantages over our affluent modern societies that protect them from many of the diseases that now afflict us. These include high bulk diets, diets with relatively few calories in proportion to other nutrients, diets low in total fat (and particularly low in saturated fat), and diets high in potassium and low in sodium. These advantages are common to such groups and appear to help protect them against a series of conditions that plague the more affluent of modern populations. Diabetes appears to be extremely rare in primitive groups (both hunter-gatherers and farmers) as are circulatory problems, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and strokes. Similarly, disorders associated with poor bowel function, such as appendicitis, hemorrhoids, and bowel cancers are extremely rare. Rates of many other types of cancer — particularly breast and lung — appear to be low in most small-scale societies. This is true even when corrected for the small proportion of the elderly often observed. Even those cancers that we now consider to be diseases of underdevelopment may be the historical product of changes in human behavior involving food storage or the human-assisted spread of infections. The record of the skeletons suggests that cancers were comparatively rare in prehistory.”

    <Paragraph>
      “The most obvious achievements of the first civilizations are the monuments — the pyramids, temples, palaces, statues, and treasures — that were created for the new ruling class of kings, nobles, priests, and their officials. But civilized life is much more than the capacity to create monuments.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Civilized life is secure life. At the most basic level this means security from the sudden destruction that village communities might suffer. Civilized life gives the feeling of permanence. It offers regularity, stability, order, even routine. Plans can be made. Expectations can be realized. People can be expected to act predictably, according to the rules.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The first cities were able to attain stability with walls that shielded the inhabitants from nomads and armies, with the first codes of law that defined human relationships, with police and officials that enforced the laws, and with institutions that functioned beyond the lives of their particular members. City life offered considerably more permanence and security than village life.”
