    <Heading>Read the following two passages:</Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      _Henry Knighton was a historian and priest at St. Mary's of Leicester in
      England. He wrote about the Black Death:_
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In 1348 and 1349, many millions of people died around the world. It began
      first in India and moved west to Tarsus, Turkey. It killed Muslims first
      and then Christians and Jews. The office of the pope believed that 48
      million people in Asia died suddenly in the first year. This did not
      include the death of Christians. The king of Tarsus was Muslim and feared
      that his people were being punished because they were not Christian. So he
      and his leaders decided to go to the pope, in France, who would baptize
      them and make them Christian. However, when he had completed 20 days of
      his journey, he heard that the plague had killed many Christians, too. So
      they turned back to return to Tarsus. But Christians, who had been
      following the king and his people, attacked and killed almost 2,000 of
      them.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Then this most terrible plague came to the coast of England. It went
      through Southampton and came to Bristol. The cruel death took just two
      days to spread through the whole town. The Scots heard that the plague was
      killing their enemy, the English. They felt God was punishing England. So
      they planned to invade England. But the awful plague soon sickened their
      soldiers. Almost 5,000 died. They retreated to Scotland, but the English
      attacked and killed many of them.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      _Giovanni Boccaccio, Italian writer from Florence wrote this description
      of the plague:_
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Others thought just the opposite. They thought the sure cure for the
      plague was to drink and be merry, to go about singing and amusing
      themselves, satisfying every appetite they could, laughing and jesting at
      what happened. They put their words into practice, spent day and night
      going from tavern to tavern, drinking immoderately, or went into other
      people's houses, doing only those things which pleased them. This they
      could easily do because everyone felt doomed and had abandoned his
      property, so that most houses became common property and any stranger who
      went in made use of them as if he had owned them. And with all this
      bestial behaviour, they avoided the sick as much as possible.
