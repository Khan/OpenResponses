    <Paragraph>An excerpt from _Wild_ by Cheryl Strayed:</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      “The trees were tall, but I was taller, standing above them on a steep
      mountain slope in northern California. Moments before, I'd removed my
      hiking boots and the left one had fallen into those trees, first
      catapulting into the air when my enormous backpack toppled onto it, then
      skittering across the gravelly trail and flying over the edge. It bounced
      off a rocky outcropping several feet beneath me before disappearing into
      the forest canopy below, impossible to retrieve. I let out a stunned gasp,
      though I'd been in the wilderness thirty-eight days and by then I'd come
      to know that anything could happen and that everything would. But that
      doesn't mean I wasn't shocked when it did.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>My boot was gone. Actually gone.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      I clutched its mate to my chest like a baby, though of course it was
      futile. What is one boot without the other boot? It is nothing. It is
      useless, an orphan forevermore, and I could take no mercy on it. It was a
      big lug of a thing, of genuine heft, a brown leather Raichle boot with a
      red lace and silver metal fasts. I lifted it high and threw it with all my
      might and watched it fall into the lush trees and out of my life.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      I was alone. I was barefoot. I was twenty-six years old and an orphan
      too.”
