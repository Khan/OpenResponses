    <Heading>Read the following two passages:</Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      “There is evidence that primitive populations suffer relatively low rates
      of many diseases compared to the more affluent modern societies. Primitive
      populations appear to enjoy several nutritional advantages over our
      affluent modern societies that protect them from many of the diseases that
      now afflict us. These include high bulk diets, diets with relatively few
      calories in proportion to other nutrients, diets low in total fat (and
      particularly low in saturated fat), and diets high in potassium and low in
      sodium. These advantages are common to such groups and appear to help
      protect them against a series of conditions that plague the more affluent
      of modern populations. Diabetes appears to be extremely rare in primitive
      groups (both hunter-gatherers and farmers) as are circulatory problems,
      including high blood pressure, heart disease, and strokes. Similarly,
      disorders associated with poor bowel function, such as appendicitis,
      hemorrhoids, and bowel cancers are extremely rare. Rates of many other
      types of cancer — particularly breast and lung — appear to be low in most
      small-scale societies. This is true even when corrected for the small
      proportion of the elderly often observed. Even those cancers that we now
      consider to be diseases of underdevelopment may be the historical product
      of changes in human behavior involving food storage or the human-assisted
      spread of infections. The record of the skeletons suggests that cancers
      were comparatively rare in prehistory.”

    <Paragraph>
      —Mark Nathan Cohen, Health and the Rise of Civilization (New Haven, CT:
      Yale UP, 1989) 138.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      “The most obvious achievements of the first civilizations are the
      monuments — the pyramids, temples, palaces, statues, and treasures — that
      were created for the new ruling class of kings, nobles, priests, and their
      officials. But civilized life is much more than the capacity to create
      monuments.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Civilized life is secure life. At the most basic level this means security
      from the sudden destruction that village communities might suffer.
      Civilized life gives the feeling of permanence. It offers regularity,
      stability, order, even routine. Plans can be made. Expectations can be
      realized. People can be expected to act predictably, according to the
      rules.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The first cities were able to attain stability with walls that shielded
      the inhabitants from nomads and armies, with the first codes of law that
      defined human relationships, with police and officials that enforced the
      laws, and with institutions that functioned beyond the lives of their
      particular members. City life offered considerably more permanence and
      security than village life.”

      York: Harper Collins, 1989).
